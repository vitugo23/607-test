## Assignment 1
OUr task is to bring a dataframe into R. I choose the 2022 World Cup Predictions database. this dataframe will include a set of predictions of all the matches of the FIFA 2022 world cup.
Some of the columns in the dataframe are:
-Date
-league ID
-League
-team1
-team2
-probabilities, and projections
-Scores


```{r}
wc_matches <- read.csv("C:/Users/vitug/Downloads/wc_matches.csv", header=FALSE)
  View(wc_matches)
```
##
Now I am going to focus on the teams and the predictions of each match
##
```{r}
wc_matches$V4
```


```{r}
wc_matches$V13
```
## Findings and Recommendations
This is the dataframe that I was able to pull in R console,I would recommend to rename the columns so we can pull more acurate information from the dataframe
